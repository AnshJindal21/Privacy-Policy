# Privacy Policy for [AI Timesheet Agent]

**Effective Date:** October 7, 2025

### 1. Introduction

Welcome to [AI Timesheet Agent] ("the Extension"), an AI-powered browser extension designed to help users submit their timesheet entries into their SAP system. This Privacy Policy explains what information we process and why, to ensure you feel secure while using our tool.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This extension is designed to be stateless, meaning we do not collect or store your personal information.

### 2. Information We Process

To function, the Extension needs to handle certain data temporarily. This processing happens in-memory and is never stored on any server.

* **User Commands:** Natural language text or voice commands you provide (e.g., "log 8 hours on project X") are processed to understand your intent.
* **Website Content:** The Extension reads necessary information from your active SAP web page, such as your employee details, project codes, and cost centers, to accurately format your timesheet entry.
* **Authentication Cookies:** The Extension uses your browser's existing session cookies for your SAP domain to make authenticated requests on your behalf. It does not handle or store your passwords.

**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any of the following:**

* Your name, employee ID, or other personally identifiable information.
* Your timesheet data or project details.
* Your browser history or activity on other websites.

### 3. How We Use Your Information

The data processed by the Extension is used exclusively for its single purpose:

* To understand your commands.
* To create a properly structured data payload for SAP.
* To submit this payload directly to your company's SAP system.

### 4. Third-Party Services (AI Processing)

To provide its "AI Agent" capabilities, the Extension sends your natural language commands (e.g., the text "log my time for today") to a third-party Large Language Model (LLM) API for processing.

* This data is used solely to interpret your command and is not stored or used for training the AI model.
* No personally identifiable information from your SAP page is sent to this third party.

### 5. Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your information. All communication between the extension, the AI service, and your SAP system is transmitted over secure HTTPS connections.

### 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the extension or on our website.
